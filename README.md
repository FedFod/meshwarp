# meshwarp

Federico's Branch

## Changes
- show_ui: now if deactivated and user clicks on the video the UI will not appear (requested, think it makes sense).

- Implemented masks.

- Now has "output_texture" attribute. 
It will output the whole scene containing the current jit.gl.meshwarp instance.
